## Description

This project allows a user to input values for an employee, including name, id, title, and annual salary. The program displays the user's values on the page in a table when the submit button is clicked. The "monthly cost" displays the sum of all the employees salaries for the month. If the value exceeds $20,000, the value will turn red to alert the user that the monthly budget for salaries has been exceeded.
